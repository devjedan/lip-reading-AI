# LipNet

Description
Key Features
Advanced Lip Reading: LipNet employs a powerful combination of Conv3D and Bidirectional LSTM layers to capture intricate lip movements and convert them into textual representations.
Real-time Lip Reading: With LipNet, you can perform lip reading in real-time, making it suitable for applications like live transcription and augmented communication devices.
Training and Customization: The project includes tools and documentation for training LipNet on your own dataset, allowing for customization and adaptation to specific use cases.



# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/devjedan/lip-reading-AI.git

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

Download raw video data from youtube or any other source and custom train the model to match the expectations.
test the model on new data and note the results.

# Dataset Preparation:
Collect and Organize Data:

Gather a dataset of videos with corresponding transcriptions. Each video should contain a person speaking, and the transcriptions should be aligned with the spoken words.
Organize the data in a directory structure where each video is associated with its transcript. For example:

data/
├── video1.mp4
├── video1.txt
├── video2.mp4
├── video2.txt
└── ...

# Data Preprocessing:

Extract video frames from the videos and convert them to grayscale.
Resize the frames to a consistent size (e.g., 75x46 pixels).
Normalize the pixel values.
Tokenize the transcriptions into characters or phonemes and convert them to numerical labels.

# Split the Dataset:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance. Common splits might be 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
Model Architecture:
LipNet typically uses a deep learning architecture that combines Convolutional 3D (Conv3D) layers and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers for lip reading. Here's an overview of the model architecture:

Input: The model takes as input a sequence of video frames, each represented as a 3D tensor (height, width, time).
Conv3D Layers: Conv3D layers are used to capture spatiotemporal features from the video frames.
Bidirectional LSTM Layers: Bidirectional LSTM layers process the output of Conv3D layers. They have a dual structure, which allows them to capture both past and future context, making them effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks like lip reading.
TimeDistributed Flatten: This layer is applied to the output of the LSTM layers to prepare the data for the final classification layer.
Dense Layer: The model ends with a dense layer with a softmax activation function. This layer outputs character probabilities for each time step.
Loss Function:
LipNet typically uses the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks. The CTC loss measures the dissimilarity between the predicted sequence of characters and the ground truth.
Optimizer:
Choose an optimizer, often Adam or RMSprop, and configure the learning rate.
Training:
Train the LipNet model using the training dataset.
Monitor training progress, including loss and validation metrics, to avoid overfitting.
Model Checkpoints:
Save model checkpoints during training to ensure you can resume training or perform inference later.
Pre-trained Weights (Optional):
You can optionally start training with pre-trained weights if they are available. Pre-trained weights may come from a model previously trained on a large dataset for lip reading.
To use pre-trained weights, initialize your LipNet model with these weights and fine-tune it on your specific dataset.
Fine-tuning typically involves freezing some layers (e.g., Conv3D and lower Bi-LSTM layers) and allowing later layers to adapt to your data.
Evaluation and Testing:
Validation:
Periodically evaluate the model on the validation dataset to monitor its performance.
Testing:
After training, test the model on the test dataset to assess its lip reading accuracy.
Inference:
Deploy the trained model for lip reading tasks in real-time or on new video data.
